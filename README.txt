# NOTES FOR TA:
I have tried my best at uploading my assets, data from the build, and my unity player from the assignment. I am not sure why it still refuses to upload even though i have placed the .gitignore file in my repo. Please email me if you have any solutions to this.

MISSING IN MY REPO:
Assets
data for exe
my unityplayer.dll

How to play my game:
Control BB8 with WASD
Click on BB8 to shoot
To exit: alt + f4

Some plane accidently dropped a surplus of stop signs and cubes, and its BB8's job to clean up the place! Run or shoot at the objects to clean up the city.

Left score: signs (threshold 13)
Right score: cubes (threshold 7)

Try to collect all the cubes and signs! The plane dropped some at nasty locations, so keep an eye out!
